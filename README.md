# g()('al')

`g()('al')` is a challenge whereby you need to write in as many languages as
possible code which enables the code `g()('al')` to return the string "goal",
the code `g()()('al')` to return the string "gooal", the code `g()()()('al')`
return the string "goooal", etc.

## Rules
1.   *You are encouraged to break the rules, cleverly.*
2.   When executed, the solution must print "goal" with sufficient o's to
     demonstrate the program's functionality.
11.  The code `g()('al')` must appear in the source.
  1.   `g()('al')` must not be a string literal.
  2.   `'al'` must be a string, or your language's equivalent thereof. You may
       use your language's standard method of creating a string (e.x. C should
       use `"`, ruby may use either `"` or `'`).
7.   `g()('al')` may not print the string. If returning a string cannot be done
     in your language, you should submit rationale as to why this is impossible
     for a solution which prints a string to be accepted.
642. You must be able to insert an infinite number of `()` calls without
     modification to your solution. Therefore solutions like
     [this][c-inc-soln3] are incorrect.
9.  `g()('al')` must be a valid [rvalue] if applicable in your language.
14. `g('al')` must return `"gal"`.
12.  If you have a solution that is close, but does not meet these rules,
     submit it anyway. A close and interesting solution is better than no
     solution.
